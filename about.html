    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Adrian Rafols, a passionate student eager to grow in the world of technology and design. I enjoy learning new skills, exploring creative ideas, and turning concepts into real projects. My portfolio reflects my journey as a learner, showcasing the work I’ve done in school and personal projects.

I’m particularly interested in [your interest area — e.g., web development, UI/UX design, or software development], and I’m continuously improving my skills through hands-on practice. Beyond academics, I love taking on challenges, collaborating with others, and finding innovative ways to solve problems.

My goal is to build a strong foundation in tech while preparing for future opportunities where I can apply my creativity and technical knowledge to make a meaningful impact.</p>
